MUTANT11

In this mutant is introduced a interaction behavior fault: 

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.Border.
The mutated code is the operation override def interimFeedback().

To produce the failure:
1. Draw a shape on canvas
2. Selecting a shape by drag-and-drop onto the drawing area
3. Scaling a shape by using the scaling handler by manipulating North, South, East, West arrows

Actual result: The shape is scaled only after the second click on those arrows.

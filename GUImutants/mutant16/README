MUTANT16

In this mutant is introduced a interaction link fault: 

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.EditingSelector
The mutated code is the operation initAction() in the ButtonPressed2DefineStylePencil class

To produce the failure:
1. Selecting any kind of shape (e.g., rectangle, square, triangle, etc.)
2. Drag-and-drop on canvas to draw the selected shape

Actual result: The rectangle shape always is drawing.

MUTANT17

In this mutant is introduced a interaction behavior fault: 

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.Pencil
The mutated code is the operation initAction() in the DnD2AddShape class

To produce the failure:
1. Selecting the freehand on toolbar
2. Drag-and-drop shortly on canvas to draw in freehand style.

Actual result: A line is drawing incorrectly (it does not follow the drag and drop interaction).

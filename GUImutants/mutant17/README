WIMP/post-WIMP: post-WIMP
Ad-hoc widgets involved: yes
interactions: DnD, button click
Test case length: 2 (Select freehand, Add freehand)
Minimal number of events to perform: 4 (press button, press canvas, move canvas, release canvas)

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.Pencil
The mutated code is the operation initAction() in the DnD2AddShape class

2. Drag-and-drop shortly on canvas to draw in freehand style.
ORACLE -> A line is drawing incorrectly (it does not follow the drag and drop interaction).

In this mutant is introduced a reversible actions fault: 

The mutated file is package package net.sf.latexdraw.actions.shape.ModifyShapeProperty
The mutated code is the operation redo().

To produce the failure:
1. Draw a shape on canvas

3. Modify its properties (e.g., border, double border, shadow, filling properties)
4. Perform a undo action and then redo this action

Actual result: The redo action does not work.

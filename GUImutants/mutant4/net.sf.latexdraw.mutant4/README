MUTANT4

In this mutant is introduced a interim feedback fault: 

The mutated file is net.sf.latexdraw.glib.ui.LCanvas.
The mutated code is the operation paintViews

To produce the failure:
1. Draw a shape on canvas
2. Drag-and-drop onto the drawing area to select a shape

Actual result: A shape is selected by drag-and-drop, but the border selection is not colorful (its white) to show the shape is being selected.

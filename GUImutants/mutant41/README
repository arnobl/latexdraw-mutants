MUTANT41
Fault category: Action
Fault: Incorrect action results
Failure description: Zooming in/out reflects incorrectly in shapes over canvas. 
WIMP/post-WIMP: post-WIMP
Ad-hoc widgets involved: yes
interactions: menu/button click 
Test case length: 2 (Select a template, Zooming in)
Minimal number of events to perform: 2 (press menu, press button/key press)

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.ui.LCanvas.
The mutated code is the operation paintViews.

To produce the failure:
1. Import a template
2. Perform zooming in (e.g., 125%) by clicking on the spinner widget (or using shortcuts (crtl + mouse wheel) or entering the values on text field spinner).
-> The corresponding template presentation is incorrectly, a shape with zoom value 125% is smaller than 100%.

MUTANT50

In this mutant is introduced a abort interaction fault: 

The mutated file is package  net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.Pencil.
The mutated code is the operation interactionStarts.

To produce the failure:
1. Draw a line or closed bézier or bézier curves by using the minimal of clicks (e.g., two clicks for a simple line).
 
Actual result: The shapes are not drawn correctly and the interaction is aborted when the right button is pressed. 
Workaround: It is necessary more clicks to draw the shapes.

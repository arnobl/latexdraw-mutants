Version 3.0.0

Added:
- Native support of LaTeX texts: texts added to drawings are compiled in pdf using latex and then imported in the drawing.
- Can place texts at different positions: bottom-left, bottom-middle, top-right, etc. This feature produces PSTricks code based on the rput command.
- new localisations: Brazilian Portuguese, Hungarian, Japanese, Turkish, Vietnamese, Serbian, Russian, Czech, Catalan.
- double borders supported for arcs.
- A system tab in the "About LaTeXDraw" dialogue box to give some information about the system.

Improvements:
- Can add/modify texts directly into the drawing using an integrated text field (no more dialogue box).
- no more dialogue boxes to change shapes properties. They can be changed using the toolbar which has been widely improved.
- when selecting a kind of shape, the corresponding widgets dedicated to the selected kind of shape are displayed to customise shapes.
- users can abort the creation of shapes using the escape key
- the graphical library has been totally rewritten:
   - better shapes movement
   - less memory consumption
   - the text is now compiled in LaTeX and imported
   - no more button to create a line; you can create a line using the button 'lines'
   - better use of handlers to resize and rotate shapes
- the undo/redo manager has been totally rewritten:
   - less memory consumption
   - more stable and efficient
   - more actions can be undone
   - more information about the undoable actions (the undo/redo messages are more precise)
- the error manager has been totally rewritten:
   - the manager can be accessed by the menu 'help' -> 'Error console'
   - the error window displays all the errors, not a single one
- the shape handlers are no more zoomed when zooming in/out.
- the widgets of the parameters toolbar now appear and disappear more accurately
- the selected shapes are no more unselected when selecting the pencil.
- can undo/redo change of unit (cm or inch).
- the lime and teal colours are now supported.
- Can zoom in/out with the keys '+' and '-'.
- PSTricks parser:
	- using a ps command as a value (e.g. linecolor=\psfillcolor) is supported
	- commands qdisk, qline, psarcn, textcolor supported
	- better support of the command definecolor
- better Mac OS X integration: the key Win/Apple is used instead of the key Ctrl in shortcuts

Changes:
- Tabs are used to replace the code panel.
- Text support:
    - Font family and font size cannot be loaded from a latexdraw 2.* svg file
    - No more widgets to define framedbox. You have to do that manually in latex.
- No more batch conversion frame
- The ldp format, that was the default format for 1.9.* and older versions, is no more supported.
- The PPM export is no more supported
- The basic EPS export is no more supported (the LaTeX EPS export is still supported).
- No more button 'default' in all the dialogue boxes.
- Handlers style has changed.
- There is no more the choice between line and curve to close a Bezier curve. Only curve is supported. That because in a 
  future release, every segment of a Bezier curve will be either a line or a curve.
- The PPC (point per centimetre) cannot be changed anymore.
- The change of unit (cm or inch) can be performed through menu items in the "Drawing" menu.
- The type of magnetic grid can be changed using the grid toolbar.
- The magnetic grid cannot be magnetic when it is not visible.
- Because handlers design have been improved, it is no more possible to change the opacity of handlers.


Fixed:
- lp#1076032: a blanck page inserted while compiling a document as a pdf
- lp#530184: the option 'showpoints' is badly painted for Bezier curves
- lp#675155: the scale handlers approximately resize shapes
- lp#675150: the unit saved into an SVG document is not loaded
- lp#598504: when you copy paste a rotated triangle/rhombus, and you move the copied shape then the rotation angle is set back to 0
- lp#880677, sf#3296077: line colour of psdot style asterisk is not saved.
- lp#911816: crash while parsing PST code containing $ and framed boxes.
- lp#756733: the pst parser did not use correctly the unit to create shapes.
- The border of a selected ellipse did not bound it correctly.
- The painted axes did not match the generated pdf because of the package pstricks-add.
- The html label of the dialogue box used to insert PST code into the drawing is now correctly displayed.
- better position of the application when several screens are available

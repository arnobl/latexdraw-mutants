MUTANT7

In this mutant is introduced a presentation fault: 

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.Hand.
The mutated code is the operation override def interimFeedback().

To produce the failure:
1. Draw a shape on canvas.
2. Drag-and-drop onto the drawing area to select a shape.

Actual result: The rectangle used for the interim feedback of the selection is not removed.

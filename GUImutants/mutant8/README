MUTANT8

In this mutant is introduced a interaction link fault: 

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.Border.
The mutated code is the operation override def updateAction() in class DnD2Rotate.

To produce the failure:
1. Draw a shape on canvas
2. Selecting a shape by drag-and-drop onto the drawing area
3. Rotating a shape by using the rotation handler 

Actual result: The selected shape is not rotated.

MUTANT9

In this mutant is introduced a interaction link fault: 

The mutated file is package net.sf.latexdraw.instruments.Border.
The mutated code is the operation setXGap in DnD2Scale class.

To produce the failure:
1. Draw a shape on canvas
2. Selecting a shape by drag-and-drop onto the drawing area
3. Scaling a shape by using the scaling handler 

Actual result: The shape is scaling only by manipulating the NE, L,SE arrows.
